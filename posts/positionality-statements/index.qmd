  Recognizing the Researcher's Perspective in Linguistic Research
---

## What is a positionality statement?

A positionality statement is a reflective piece of writing that acknowledges the researcher's positionality, which encompasses their social, cultural, and personal identity, as well as their biases and assumptions. 
Positionality statements aim to increase transparency and promote critical self-reflection in research.

Why is positionality important in research and, specifically, in linguistic research?
Positionality is important in research because it can impact how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted. 
Linguistic research, in particular, often deals with social phenomena that are influenced by language use and the cultural context in which it occurs. 
Recognizing one's positionality in linguistic research is crucial to understanding how it might influence the research process and findings.
Why should positionality statements be included in quantitative research as well?
Traditionally, positionality statements have been more prevalent in qualitative research, but they are also important in quantitative research. 
In quantitative research, recognizing and addressing the researcher's positionality can increase the validity of the findings. 
Including positionality statements in quantitative research can also address diversity and inclusivity gaps, help make research more open and transparent, and promote DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging) initiatives.

## Steps for the future

To promote critical self-reflection and increase transparency in linguistic research, researchers should consider their positionality before starting a project and write a positionality statement if relevant. 
The positionality statement can be included in additional materials if the word limit is a concern for publication. 
By reflecting on who it is that does the research, the field of linguistics can become more diverse, inclusive, and transparent.

In sum, positionality statements are important in linguistic research as they promote critical self-reflection, increase transparency, and help address diversity and inclusivity gaps. 
Including positionality statements in quantitative research can increase the validity of findings and promote DEIB initiatives. 
By reflecting on who it is that does the research, linguistics can become a more diverse, inclusive, and transparent field.

### Positionality Statement

**1. What is a positionality statement?**

-  Definition

**2. Why is positionality important in research and, specifically, in linguistic research?**

- Positionality addresses where the researcher is coming from when conducting a particular research;

- Recognizing one’s positionality and writing a positionality statement has traditionally been associated with **qualitative research** and has been more prevalent in subfields of linguistics (e.g., sociolinguistics) or intersecting fields (e.g., anthropology);

- **Quantitative research** has traditionally been viewed as “hard science” and the quantitative researcher as objective, thus there did not seem to be a need for quantitative researchers to reflect on their positionality;

**3. Why should positionality statements be included in quantitative research as well?**

- Good for validity (see Jafar, 2018)

- The medical field and the psychological field is (slowly) seeing efforts around inclusing positionality in quantitative research (see Jamieson et al., 2022)

- It also addresses diversity and inclusivity gaps in research – connection with DEIB initiatives & connection with making research open and transparent (aka we should know _who_ is doing the research)

**4. Steps for the future**

- Consider your own positionality before starting a project;

- Consider writing a positionality statement for your research; it can be included in additional materials if the word limit is a concern for publication;

- Help create a more open and transparent field for research in linguistics by reflecting on who it is that does the research.

**5. Conclusion**


NOTES:
I focused on quantitative vs qualitative because (1) positionality is associated with qualitative projects, and (2) when discussing open practices in research, the conversation can be overtaken by the focus on quantitative materials. However, some qualitative practices would benefit openness and transparency in research.
