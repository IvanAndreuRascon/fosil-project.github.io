## What is preregistration?

Preregistration refers to a timestamped outline of a study which include components such as research questions, hypotheses, methods, and analysis. 
Preregistration differs from other open science practices such as registered reports and preprints as it is registered in a repository prior to data collection and it isnâ€™t peer reviewed. 
Preregistration can vary a lot in detail; the simplest level with the least amount of detail can include just the hypothesis and a brief description of the methods, whereas more difficult levels with greater detail can include components such as writing analysis code beforehand in addition to the components from the simpler levels. 
More information on the different components that can be included in preregistration will be mentioned in the following sections. 

- Timestamped outline including research questions, hypotheses, methods, and analysis
- Needs to be before data collection
- Can be in varying levels of detail


## Who is this for and how is it gonna be applied?

Preregistration is an important practice in conducting open science, which anyone in academia conducting research can implement. 
This tutorial will be focusing on preregistration specifically for researchers in any field of linguistics. 
Many of the points such as "things to consider" and "How to preregister?" can be applied to other fields as well. 
Topics covered in this section include 1. what is preregistration? 2. Why do we conduct preregistration? 3. Things to consider to preregister 4.  How to implement preregistration in linguistics? and 5. How to preregister?

## Why do we do preregistration?

Researchers often have some degree of inherent flexibility in the process of designing and conducting research studies. 
This concept is also known as researcher degrees of freedom. 
With having the freedom to choose between various methods of collecting data and performing analyses, it can be easy to end up with false-positive results (i.e. an incorrect finding showing statistically significant result). 
The purpose of preregisteration is to deter individuals from conducting questionable research practices (QRPs) either intentionally or unintentionally by requiring them to document various components of the study. 
QRPs can lead to bias in the results, which can further lead to inaccurate conclusions. 
An example of QRPs which can be avoided through preregistration is HARKing or hypothesizing after the results are known. 
HARKing can be detrimental for research studies as it presents hypotheses determined after finding results as a hypothesis formed prior to the study. Another example of QRPs is p-hacking, where data is methodically excluded to result in a statistically significant result when there isn't an actual effect between the variables. 
Preregistration avoids such practices because it forces researchers to record their hypotheses and methods prior to data collection. 
Researchers can also determine stopping rule and exclusion principals in advance, so that there's less chance of p-hacking. 
HARKing along with p-hacking lead to scientific studies being difficult or impossible to be reproduced. 
Since reproducibility is an important part of the scientific process, not being able to reproduce results leads to theories building off on these papers to be questioned for their credibility. 
By preregistering, we can ensure that results can be replicated due to derailed laid out information about data collection procedures. 
There are many additional benefits to preregistering studies. 
Preregisteration can act as proof of confirmatory research for researchers, as it distinguishes decisions made before and after data collection. 
Encouraging greater level of detail in preregistration also helps researchers to focus on conceptualizing their research prior to conducting it. 
Having detailed preregistration also allows any issues to be discussed and sorted before data collection, which further eliminates any sources of error. 

- Deter pele from QRPs
    - Ex. HARKing and p-hacking
    - Documenting researchers degree of freedom
- Proof of confirmatory research: Distinguishes between decisions made before and after collecting data
- Conceptualization stage: Very helpful because it forces researcher to plan out their studies
    - Determine stopping rule and exclusion in advance
    - Reproducibility because of detailed laid out information
- Proofread: Any issues can be discussed and sorted out before data collection
    - Eliminates sources of error 


## Things to consider

### Type of study

Just as we previously discussed, one of the primary purposes of preregistration is to distinguish between confirmatory research and exploratory research, therefore it can be the start-point of preregistration. 
In addition, there are more types of study than the two we just mentioned, and it would be helpful to determine and preregister them before the beginning of the study, as it can be the methodological base for your study. 
Here type of study does not refer to the branches of linguistic studies or specialized areas of linguistic studies: we use it to categorize the **methodology** and **purpose** of the studies. 
In Figure 1 we listed some of the common types of study in linguistic research. 
It is worth mentioning that often one study can fit into multiple types listed in Figure 1.

### Parts to include in preregistration

Moving forward we are going to discuss what content could be included in preregistration. 
To put it simply, we can imagine it as a conference paper, or a research proposal, thus we have four components (Kathallawa et al, 2021):

1. RQ 
2. Hypotheses
3. Method
4. Analysis plan

Again, we'd like to stress that, it may be overwhelming to incorporate all four of them if you are one step in the practice of Open Science, so feel free to pick what might be most relevant to your study to begin with, and maybe engage more when you feel more comfortable with this practice in the future. 
Also, you can have maximum flexibility on the complexity of preregister each component. 

### Level of details

A lot of concerns of putting Open Science into practice or doing preregistration are about the possible overload of "extra work". 
On the contrary, preregistration should be helping us work in a more efficient manner both in the long run and in short terms. 
Besides, you have complete control of how much detail you want to include. 
The more detailed the preregistration is, the more effort you need to put into, and as a result the less work down the road. 
Here we only propose some of the levels of details that may help you determine how much details you can incorporate in your preregistration (Figure 2). 
The darker the shade, the more detailed it is (thus more work). 
Again, you can always incorporate different levels of details in different parts.

#| echo: false

## How can we make it?

There are websites dedicated to Open Science practices. 
OSF is one and it provide platform and/or template we can use. 


::: {.panel-tabset}

## OSF

- [OSF](https://osf.io/)
  - [Start from scratch](https://help.osf.io/article/162-start-a-registration#start-a-registration-from-scratch) 
  - [Start from an existing OSF project or component](https://help.osf.io/article/162-start-a-registration#start-a-registration-from-an-existing-project-or-component-1)

## Github

Pre registration involves making a plan for your research project before collecting and analyzing data. This plan can be documented and shared on Github, which is a popular web-based hosting service for version control and collaborative software development. 

Here are the steps to set up a pre registration for your research on Github:

1. Create a Github account: If you do not already have a Github account, create one by visiting the Github homepage and following the instructions.
2. Create a new repository: Once you are logged in to Github, you can create a new repository to store your pre registration documents. Click the "New" button in the top left corner of the screen and follow the prompts to create a new repository.
3. Choose a template: Github provides several templates for different types of repositories. You can choose a template that is specifically designed for pre registration documents, such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) Preregistration template.
4. Add your pre registration documents: Once you have chosen a template, you can add your pre registration documents to the repository. These documents should include a detailed description of your research question, hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan. You can use Markdown, a lightweight markup language, to format your documents on Github.
5. Share your repository: Once your pre registration documents are complete, you can share your repository with other researchers or members of the public. You can do this by sharing the link to your repository or by inviting collaborators to contribute to the project.
6. Update your repository: As you collect and analyze data, you may need to update your pre registration documents. You can do this by making changes to your documents on Github and committing the changes to the repository.

By setting up a preregistration on Github, you can make your research more transparent and reproducible. Other researchers can review your plan and provide feedback, and you can use the repository to document any changes you make to your research plan over time.

## Aspredicted.org 

1. One author creates the pre-registration.
2. Participating authors are emailed, requesting approval.
3. If all approve, it is saved but remains private until an author makes it public; or remains private forever.(Why?)
4. Authors may share an anonymous version of the pre-registration with reviewers.
5. If made public, the final .pdf (sample) is automatically stored in the web-archive.

## By hand

Write, timestamp + freeze, and then check yourself 

To set up a pre registration for your research from scratch on paper, you can follow these steps:

1. Define your research question and hypotheses: Start by identifying the research question you are trying to answer and any hypotheses you have about the expected results.
2. Select your variables and measures: Identify the independent and dependent variables in your study and describe the measures you will use to operationalize these variables.
3. Determine your sample size and recruitment strategy: Specify the number of participants you plan to recruit and describe how you will recruit them.
4. Outline your research design: Describe the research design you will use to address your research question, such as a between-subjects or within-subjects design.
5. Specify your data analysis plan: Describe the statistical analyses you plan to use to test your hypotheses, including any planned exploratory analyses and methods to handle missing data.
6. Plan for ethical considerations: Address any ethical considerations in your study, such as obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring confidentiality and privacy, and handling any potential risks or harms.
7. Consider any potential limitations: Anticipate any potential limitations of your study, such as sampling bias or measurement error.
8. Write up your pre registration plan: Once you have completed these steps, write up your pre registration plan in a clear and concise manner on paper. Be sure to include all relevant information, such as your research question, hypotheses, variables and measures, sample size and recruitment strategy, research design, data analysis plan, ethical considerations, and potential limitations.
