\nOr perhaps the entire syllable? \nWhere exactly is the measurement taken? \nThe mid-point, perhaps? \nOr maybe an average over the entire syllable?\nAll of these choices can have crucial consequences on downstream analyses. \nThis type of inherent flexibility is referred to as researcher degrees of freedom. \nThe purpose of preregisteration is to deter individuals from QRPs, such as HARKing or p-hacking, by requiring them to document critical aspects of the study. \nPreregistration avoids such practices because it forces researchers to record their hypotheses and methods prior to data collection. \n\n<aside>\nFor more information about QRPs see XXX.\n</aside>\n\nThere are many additional benefits to preregistering studies. \nPreregisteration can act as proof of confirmatory research for researchers, as it distinguishes decisions made before and after data collection. \nEncouraging greater level of detail in preregistration also helps researchers to focus on conceptualizing their research prior to conducting it. \nHaving detailed preregistration also allows any issues to be discussed and sorted before data collection, which further eliminates any sources of error. \n\n\n## What should you pregister?\n\n### Type of study\n\nJust as we previously discussed, one of the primary purposes of preregistration is to distinguish between confirmatory research and exploratory research, therefore it can be the start-point of preregistration. \nIn addition, there are more types of study than the two we just mentioned, and it would be helpful to determine and preregister them before the beginning of the study, as it can be the methodological base for your study. \nHere type of study does not refer to the branches of linguistic studies or specialized areas of linguistic studies: we use it to categorize the **methodology** and **purpose** of the studies. \nIn Figure 1 we listed some of the common types of study in linguistic research. \nIt is worth mentioning that often one study can fit into multiple types listed in Figure 1.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Need fig cap](prereg1.png){#fig-study-types width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Parts to include in preregistration\n\nMoving forward we are going to discuss what content could be included in preregistration. \nTo put it simply, we can imagine it as a conference paper, or a research proposal, thus we have four components (Kathallawa et al, 2021):\n\n1. RQ \n2. Hypotheses\n3. Method\n4. Analysis plan\n\nAgain, we'd like to stress that, it may be overwhelming to incorporate all four of them if you are one step in the practice of Open Science, so feel free to pick what might be most relevant to your study to begin with, and maybe engage more when you feel more comfortable with this practice in the future. \nAlso, you can have maximum flexibility on the complexity of preregister each component. \n\n### Level of details\n\nA lot of concerns of putting Open Science into practice or doing preregistration are about the possible overload of \"extra work\". \nOn the contrary, preregistration should be helping us work in a more efficient manner both in the long run and in short terms. \nBesides, you have complete control of how much detail you want to include. \nThe more detailed the preregistration is, the more effort you need to put into, and as a result the less work down the road. \nHere we only propose some of the levels of details that may help you determine how much details you can incorporate in your preregistration (Figure 2). \nThe darker the shade, the more detailed it is (thus more work). \nAgain, you can always incorporate different levels of details in different parts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Levels of detail](prereg2.png){#fig-what-to-prereg width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## How to preregister your study\n\nThere are websites dedicated to Open Science practices. \nOSF is one and it provide platform and/or template we can use. \n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## OSF\n\n- [OSF](https://osf.io/)\n  - [Start from scratch](https://help.osf.io/article/162-start-a-registration#start-a-registration-from-scratch) \n  - [Start from an existing OSF project or component](https://help.osf.io/article/162-start-a-registration#start-a-registration-from-an-existing-project-or-component-1)\n\n## Github\n\nPre registration involves making a plan for your research project before collecting and analyzing data. This plan can be documented and shared on Github, which is a popular web-based hosting service for version control and collaborative software development. \n\nHere are the steps to set up a pre registration for your research on Github:\n\n1. Create a Github account: If you do not already have a Github account, create one by visiting the Github homepage and following the instructions.\n2. Create a new repository: Once you are logged in to Github, you can create a new repository to store your pre registration documents. Click the \"New\" button in the top left corner of the screen and follow the prompts to create a new repository.\n3. Choose a template: Github provides several templates for different types of repositories. You can choose a template that is specifically designed for pre registration documents, such as the Open Science Framework (OSF) Preregistration template.\n4. Add your pre registration documents: Once you have chosen a template, you can add your pre registration documents to the repository. These documents should include a detailed description of your research question, hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan. You can use Markdown, a lightweight markup language, to format your documents on Github.\n5. Share your repository: Once your pre registration documents are complete, you can share your repository with other researchers or members of the public. You can do this by sharing the link to your repository or by inviting collaborators to contribute to the project.\n6. Update your repository: As you collect and analyze data, you may need to update your pre registration documents. You can do this by making changes to your documents on Github and committing the changes to the repository.\n\nBy setting up a preregistration on Github, you can make your research more transparent and reproducible. Other researchers can review your plan and provide feedback, and you can use the repository to document any changes you make to your research plan over time.\n\n## Aspredicted.org \n\n1. One author creates the pre-registration.\n2. Participating authors are emailed, requesting approval.\n3. If all approve, it is saved but remains private until an author makes it public; or remains private forever.(Why?)\n4. Authors may share an anonymous version of the pre-registration with reviewers.\n5. If made public, the final .pdf (sample) is automatically stored in the web-archive.\n\n## By hand\n\nWrite, timestamp + freeze, and then check yourself \n\nTo set up a pre registration for your research from scratch on paper, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define your research question and hypotheses: Start by identifying the research question you are trying to answer and any hypotheses you have about the expected results.\n2. Select your variables and measures: Identify the independent and dependent variables in your study and describe the measures you will use to operationalize these variables.\n3. Determine your sample size and recruitment strategy: Specify the number of participants you plan to recruit and describe how you will recruit them.\n4. Outline your research design: Describe the research design you will use to address your research question, such as a between-subjects or within-subjects design.\n5. Specify your data analysis plan: Describe the statistical analyses you plan to use to test your hypotheses, including any planned exploratory analyses and methods to handle missing data.\n6. Plan for ethical considerations: Address any ethical considerations in your study, such as obtaining informed consent from participants, ensuring confidentiality and privacy, and handling any potential risks or harms.\n7. Consider any potential limitations: Anticipate any potential limitations of your study, such as sampling bias or measurement error.\n8. Write up your pre registration plan: Once you have completed these steps, write up your pre registration plan in a clear and concise manner on paper. Be sure to include all relevant information, such as your research question, hypotheses, variables and measures, sample size and recruitment strategy, research design, data analysis plan, ethical considerations, and potential limitations.\n\n:::\n\n\nTo read more about preregistration in linguisticis:\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ling-2019-0048/html?lang=en\n\nReference\nKathawalla, U.
