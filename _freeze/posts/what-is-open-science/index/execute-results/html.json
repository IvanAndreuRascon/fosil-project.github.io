Open science consists of principles and behaviors that promote transparent, credible, reproducible, and accessible science. Open science has six major aspects: open data, open methodology, open source, open access, open peer review, and open educational resources.\n\nThat sounds wonderful, right? \nBut you might be asking yourself *why* the push for Open Science?\nIt may come as a surprise to some, but the open, transparent research practices described by @parsons2022community have not been the norm in scholarly research. \n\nTo properly contextualize the need for Open Science, we have to go back to the early 2010's. \nAround this time, several fields of research embarked on large-scale replication projects to scrutinize some of their major findings.\nOne example of these projects took place in psychology. \nThis particular project tested whether they could replicate 100 influential findings [@open2015estimating].\nThey found the approximately 53% of the findings did not replicate. \nThis project inspired similar large-scale replication projects in other fields, yielding similar results in economics [@camerer2016evaluating], social sciences [@camerer2018evaluating], and cancer research [@errington2021investigating]. \nThese alarming findings are now referred to as the replication (or reproducibility) crisis. \nResearchers have pointed to questionable research practices (QRPs), p-hacking, HARKing, small sample sizes, poor theory, lack of transparency, etc. as factors that ultimately led to the replication crisis, though it is likely that other factors are at play. \n\n<aside>\nTake a second to consider your field of study. \nHow many important findings do you think would replicate? \nIf you were to replicate 100 of the most influential findings, how many would need to replicate for you to have confidence in your field?\n</aside>\n\nIn the aftermath of the replication crisis we have seen a push for increased transparency and reproducible methodology to help mitigate the effects of questionable research practices. \nThe resulting methodological framework and associated techniques have reshaped research methods in psychology and have slowly but surely made their way into adjacent fields. \nThis website is dedicated to making open science practices understandable and accessible to researchers in the speech sciences from all backgrounds and at every stage, from students/early career researchers to senior researchers. \n\nTo this end, we have highlighted 7 areas in which speech researchers can engage in Open Science: \n\n\n- Literate programming\n- Open data\n- Positionality statements\n- Preprints\n- Preregistration\n- Registered reports\n- Reproducible code/projects\n\n\nThroughout this website you will find tutorials designed to get you up and running in each of these areas so that you can engage in Open Science practices.  \n\nSee @fig-open-science-wiki\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![This is a caption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Osc2021-unesco-open-science-no-gray.png/640px-Osc2021-unesco-open-science-no-gray.png){#fig-open-science-wiki}\n:::\n:::\n",
